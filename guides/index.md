#### Installation

The [installation guide](/guides/installation/) will get you set up to build and
run `lnd` from the command line.

#### Tutorial

The tutorial is a holistic tour that is intended to teach all the
skills necessary to work with `lnd`, by walking through a setup of `lnd`, a lnd
client, RPC, and integration into a web application.

#### gRPC Guides

The gRPC guides will get you started sending command through gRPC. We have
written language specific guides for Python and Javascript:

* [Python](/guides/python-grpc/)
* [Javascript](/guides/javascript-grpc/)

#### Docker 

The [Docker guide](/guides/docker/) teaches you how to package `lnd` and `btcd`
together to make deployment of multiple daemons a bit simpler.
