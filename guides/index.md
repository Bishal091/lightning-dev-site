This page lists the writeups available on specific skills in and around LND.

#### LND Overview and Developer Guide

Modeled after the Bitcoin Developer Guide, the [LND Overview and Developer
Guide](/overview/) will provide the necessary conceptual background for
developers looking to build on LND.

#### Installation

The [installation guide](/guides/installation/) will get you set up to build and
run `lnd` from the command line.

#### Tutorial

The [tutorial](/tutorial/) is a holistic tour that is intended to teach all the
dev-specific skills necessary to work with `lnd`, by walking through a setup of
`lnd`, a lnd client, RPC, and integration into a web application. This should be
completed in tandem with the [LND Overview and Developer Guide](/overview/).

#### gRPC Guides

The gRPC guides will get you started sending command through gRPC. We have
written language specific guides for Python and Javascript:

* [Python](/guides/python-grpc/)
* [Javascript](/guides/javascript-grpc/)

#### Docker 

The [Docker guide](/guides/docker/) teaches you how to package `lnd` and `btcd`
together to make deployment of multiple daemons a bit simpler.
